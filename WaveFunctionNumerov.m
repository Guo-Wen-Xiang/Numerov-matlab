function WaveFunction = WaveFunctionNumerov(WaveFunction, E_guess, sgn)
    %{
        This function calculates the wave function values depending on the potential by using the Numerov method. The function returns a matrix that contains the wave function value.
    Parameter:
    ----------
        WaveFunction: the initialized wave function with the coordinates in the first row, the first two columns as the initial
        V_eff: 2 * (E_guess - Potential)
        Len: the size of the wave function matrix
        E_guess: the energy level guessed
        h: the step
        sgn: +1 (forward propagating), -1 (backward propagating)

    Returns:
    --------
        WaveFunction (2 * Len, matrix)
    %}
    global Potential Len step

    if size(WaveFunction, 2) ~= size(Potential, 2)
        error('Error!!!\nThe size of WaveFunction or Potential Wrong!')
    end

    V_eff = 2 * (E_guess - Potential);

    for j = 3 : Len

        % Forward or backward propagating
        if sgn == -1
            i = Len - j + 1;
        else
            i = j;
        end

        c0 = 1/12 * step^2 * V_eff(1, i);
        c1 = 1/12 * step^2 * V_eff(1, i - sgn*1);
        c2 = 1/12 * step^2 * V_eff(1, i - sgn*2);
        
        WaveFunction(2, i) = ((2 - 10*c1) * WaveFunction(2, i - sgn*1) - (1 + c2) * WaveFunction(2, i - sgn*2)) / (1 + c0);
